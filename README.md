# Mock Biometric Test Server

This is a mock biometric API server designed for use in biometric Proof-of-Concept (PoC) environments. It simulates biometric **enrolment**, **identification**, and **gallery management**, exposing a simple REST API with interactive Swagger documentation.

## Features

- Just 3 manidtory REST API's for **/enroll**, **/identify**, and **/clear** for accuracy
- One optional API **/pad** for testing pad
- Input: Base64-encoded images
- Output: Simulated template IDs and match scores
- Swagger UI for interactive API testing
- Processing time (in milliseconds) included in every response

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Note this currently only designed be run completely inside a secure trusted testing network, and so there is currently no encryption or authentication on REST calls.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- supply your own face image (in the client currently its face1.jpeg)


### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install flask flasgger
````

---

## Running the Server

```bash
python mock_server.py
```

The server will start on:

```
http://localhost:5001
```

---

## Swagger UI

Interactive API documentation and testing is available at:

```
http://localhost:5001/apidocs/
```

---

## API Endpoints

### üîπ `POST /enroll`

Enrolls a biometric template from a Base64-encoded image.

#### Request Body:

```json
{
  "image": "<base64-encoded-image>"
}
```

#### Success Response:

```json
{
  "template_id": "uuid-string",
  "processing_time_ms": 3
}
```

#### Error Response:
e.g.
```json
{
   "error": "FTE: Unable to decode image"
}
```
---

### üîπ `POST /identify`

Performs identification against the enrolled gallery.

(optional top_k:

* type: integer
* minimum: 1, maximum: 100
* default: 100
* description: Number of top matches to return (max 100)))

#### Request Body:

```json
{
  "image": "<base64-encoded-image>"
}
```

#### Success Response:

```json
{
  "matches": [
    {"template_id": "uuid-1", "score": 0.982},
    ...
  ],
  "processing_time_ms": 5
}
```

#### Error Response:
e.g.
```json
{
   "error": "FTA: Unable to decode image"
}
```
---

### üîπ `POST /clear`

Clears the in-memory biometric gallery.

#### Success Response:

```json
{
  "message": "Template gallery cleared",
  "processing_time_ms": 1
}
```

---

## üîç Passive PAD (Presentation Attack Detection)

### üîπ `POST /pad`

Simulates a passive PAD check to determine whether a biometric image represents a live person or a spoof (e.g. printed photo or screen replay).

#### Request Body:
```json
{
  "image": "<base64-encoded-image>"
}
```

#### Response:
```json
{
  "is_live": true,
  "reason": "Face structure consistent with live subject",
  "processing_time_ms": 3
}
```
Response includes a human-readable explanation and processing time.

Intended for testing integration and fallback logic in client applications.

## Testing the API

A sample client (`mock_client.py`) can be created to automate image uploads and interaction with the server. You can also use Swagger UI or tools like Postman.

In practice this will be used to enroll and test various galleries.

---

## Notes

* This is a **mock application only** for integration testing. No actual biometric algorithms are used in this repo.
* The `TEMPLATE_DB` is stored in memory and cleared on restart or via `/clear`.
* Intended for PoC and testing integrations in secure environments (e.g. behind VPN).
