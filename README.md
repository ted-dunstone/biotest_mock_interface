# Mock Biometric Test Server

This is a mock biometric API server designed for use in biometric Proof-of-Concept (PoC) environments. It simulates biometric **enrolment**, **identification**, and **gallery management**, exposing a simple REST API with interactive Swagger documentation.

## Features

- Just 3 REST API's for **/enroll**, **/identify**, and **/clear**
- Input: Base64-encoded images
- Output: Simulated template IDs and match scores
- Swagger UI for interactive API testing
- Processing time (in milliseconds) included in every response

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- supply your own face image (in the client currently its face1.jpeg)


### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install flask flasgger
````

---

## Running the Server

```bash
python mock_server.py
```

The server will start on:

```
http://localhost:5001
```

---

## Swagger UI

Interactive API documentation and testing is available at:

```
http://localhost:5001/apidocs/
```

---

## API Endpoints

### ðŸ”¹ `POST /enroll`

Enrolls a biometric template from a Base64-encoded image.

#### Request Body:

```json
{
  "image": "<base64-encoded-image>"
}
```

#### Success Response:

```json
{
  "template_id": "uuid-string",
  "processing_time_ms": 3
}
```

#### Error Response:
e.g.
```json
{
   "error": "FTE: Unable to decode image"
}
```
---

### ðŸ”¹ `POST /identify`

Performs identification against the enrolled gallery.

#### Request Body:

```json
{
  "image": "<base64-encoded-image>"
}
```

#### Success Response:

```json
{
  "matches": [
    {"template_id": "uuid-1", "score": 0.982},
    ...
  ],
  "processing_time_ms": 5
}
```

#### Error Response:
e.g.
```json
{
   "error": "FTA: Unable to decode image"
}
```
---

### ðŸ”¹ `POST /clear`

Clears the in-memory biometric gallery.

#### Success Response:

```json
{
  "message": "Template gallery cleared",
  "processing_time_ms": 1
}
```

---

## Testing the API

A sample client (`mock_client.py`) can be created to automate image uploads and interaction with the server. You can also use Swagger UI or tools like Postman.

In practice this will be used to enroll and test various galleries.

---

## Notes

* This is a **simulation only**. No actual biometric algorithms are used.
* The `TEMPLATE_DB` is stored in memory and cleared on restart or via `/clear`.
* Intended for PoC and testing integrations in secure environments (e.g. behind VPN).
